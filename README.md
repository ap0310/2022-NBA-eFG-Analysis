# Summary
This report uses data from the 2022-23 NBA regular season on Pro Basketball Reference to discuss the potential oversaturation of 3-point shooting in the NBA by analyzing eFG%, minutes played, average +/-, and points generated. Because this report and analysis were performed on 5/11/2023, the narrative surrounding this report is outdated to modern NBA statistics. If another analysis were performed with modernized data, evidence suggesting 3-point oversaturation would likely be stronger due to leaguewide increases of 3PA and pace evident by the 2024 Boston Celtics, the most recent champions at the time of this repository's creation.
